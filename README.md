Generate Eliom forms content from runtime type representations
==============================================================

Runtime type representation is generated by [deriving-typerepr](https://github.com/benozol/deriving-typerepr), as we are waiting for the [native implementation in OCaml](https://gitorious.org/ocaml-ty) :-)
Then, it's easy:
```ocaml
type my = A of int option * string | B deriving (Typerepr, Json)
```
```ocaml
let service =
  App.register_post_coservice'
    ~post_params:(Eliom_parameter.caml "arg" Json.t<my>)
    (fun () my -> ...)
```
```ocaml
let form =
   let open Eliom_content.Html5.F in
   get_form ~service
     (fun name -> [
        Eliom_form_generator.content Typerepr.t<my> name;
        button ~button_type:`Submit [pcdata "ok"];
        ])
```
